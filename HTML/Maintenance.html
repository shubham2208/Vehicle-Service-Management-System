        <ul><li>Bike maintenance :- First off, you need to keep your bike well tuned with timely servicing. Keep all the parts of your vehicle oiled.This is because regular servicing is like a regular health check for your bike.</li><li>Speed :- Maintain optimum speed. For bikes it is economical to go in the 40-60 kmph speed. If you increase speed beyond this, more fuel gets consumed for the same distance. Riding at slower pace than the optimum at low gears is a very bad practice and it gives a poor mileage to your bike. Therefore, avoid riding bike in low gear as much as possible and always go at optimum speed at the top gear. Gear change at right time gives enhanced mileage for your bike.
</li><li>Air pressure :- Air pressure in tyres should always be maintained at the optimum, as mentioned by the bike owner manual. Less air in the tyres leads to increased friction between the road surface and tyres which demands more fuel. Keeping the air pressure of tyres at optimum helps in ensuring less resistance thereby also increasing the fuel efficiency.
</li>
<li>Braking :- Avoid applying sudden brakes to the extent possible because it tends to waste more energy. It is better to reduce the speed by easing the throttle rather than applying sudden brakes. ‘Smooth’ should be the keyword in accelerating or reducing the speed.
</li><li>Fuel :- Always buy fuel in the morning as it is sold by volume and expands during the day when it gets hot.</li>
<li>Throttle and clutch :- Throttle opening also is important, never open it wide and part open is what gives the best fuel efficiency. Maintain the clutch well, because slipping of clutch wastes lot of fuel.
</li>
<li>Starting :- Another great tip for proper oil circulation in the engine is to self start the engine and leaving it for a while so the oil gets heated up and can flow easily up to the top of the engine.
</li>
<li>Excess is bad :- Excess gadgetry such as over sized horns, lights as well as bigger sized tyres too can be a drain on fuel. Avoid adding weight to the bike through heavier guards, heavier visors, crash guards etc. It does have a lot of impact on the mileage.</li></ul>
